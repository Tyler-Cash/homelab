## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Please don't judge the commit history and some janky components too harshly, I'm just doing this for fun in my spare time with the majority of these services not exposed to the Internet.

## ‚õµ Overview

This is a repository for my Kubernetes cluster. ([Shamelessly stolen README](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops)) I have all of my ArgoCD applications here to deploy all of the infrastructure and services I use at home.

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned currently provisioned with a (Somewhat janky) [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) script you can find [here](https://github.com/Tyler-Cash/k3s-ansible). Currently the Ansible process creates VMs in my Proxmox hypervisor, it isn't idompotent though, so it's more just a collection of the scripts that I use to build things. That said, I can create a new cluster from scratch within about 40m~, by running only 2 commands. Not terrible, but not great either.

Once the k3s cluster is up, the Ansible script will bootstrap ArgoCD and then my app of apps, which will deploy all applications to the cluster.

### Core Components

- [authentik](https://goauthentik.io/): SSO for the services that support LDAP/SAML/OIDC.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.
- [kyverno](https://kyverno.io/): Policy management for cluster (ie. Setup all pods with timezone Australia/Sydney)
- [loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/): Centralized log storage
- [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)/[alert manager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)/ [grafana](https://grafana.com/): Observability and alerting
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sealed-secrets](https://sealed-secrets.netlify.app/): Secret manager so secrets can be stored encrypted in git 
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) and [snapscheduler](https://github.com/backube/snapscheduler): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

### Ingress Controller

Over WAN, I have port forwarded ports `80` and `443` to the load balancer IP of my [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) controller that's running in my Kubernetes cluster.

### Internal DNS

[CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is deployed in my k8s cluster. All DNS queries for _**k8s.tylercash.dev**_ domains are forwarded to [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) that is running in my cluster. With this setup `k8s_gateway` has direct access to my clusters ingresses and services and serves DNS for them in my internal network.

### Ad Blocking

The [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) deployment has a volume with a hosts file present on it. This hostfile is updated frequently by a [CronJob run in cluster](manifests\networking\adblock-updater\cron.yaml). CoreDNS is configured to drop any entries that are matched in this file, which results in ads failing to load.

### External DNS

[external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in my cluster and configure to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingresses `external-dns` looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an annotation of `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`

### Dynamic DNS

~~My home IP can change at any given time and in order to keep my WAN IP address up to date on Cloudflare. [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) has a native Dynamic DNS tool which I use to update my IP in cloudflare

## ü§ù Gratitude and Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
